      %h1 Design Miami Challenge
      %h2 (codename: FUN DMC)
      :markdown
        The Design Miami Challenge for April 2011 is to design and build a
        website for a fictional Canadian-cuisine restaurant here in Coconut
        Grove. We will provide you with the menu, hours, and address, and you
        get to design and build the site. At the May meetup, you'll present
        your idea, we'll all vote on a winner, and you'll win a prize of my
        choosing.

        For mid-competition updates, follow

    %h1 Restaurant Information
    :markdown
      "The Grand Canadian Cafe" is a new bistro in Coconut Grove featuring
      a selection of Canadian/American fusion cuisine celebrating the
      culture, heritage, and spirit of America's neighbor to the North.

      The restaurant is located at 2975 Oak Ave, Miami Florida, 33133
      (this is actually Fire Station #8), is open for breakfast, lunch, and
      dinner; and has a bar open until midnight. While many people think of
      the big eastern metropolis of Toronto when they think "Canada,"
      also think of Calgary, home of the largest rodeo in the world;
      Banff, a resort town in the Rocky Mountains; and Vancouver, Canada's
      gateway to Asia.  You might also think about Saskatchewan, which grows
      much of Canada's food; and the Northwest Territories, home of the
      TV series "Ice Road Truckers."
