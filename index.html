      <h1>Design Miami Challenge</h1>
      <h2>(codename: FUN DMC)</h2>
      <p>The Design Miami Challenge for April 2011 is to design and build a
      website for a fictional Canadian-cuisine restaurant here in Coconut
      Grove. We will provide you with the menu, hours, and address, and you
      get to design and build the site. At the May meetup, you'll present
      your idea, we'll all vote on a winner, and you'll win a prize of my
      choosing.</p>

    <h1>Restaurant Information</h1>
    <p>"The Grand Canadian Cafe" is a new bistro in Coconut Grove featuring
    a selection of Canadian/American fusion cuisine celebrating the
    culture, heritage, and spirit of America's neighbor to the North.</p>
    
    <p>The restaurant is located at 2975 Oak Ave, Miami Florida, 33133
    (this is actually Fire Station #8), is open for breakfast, lunch, and
    dinner; and has a bar open until midnight. While many people think of
    the big eastern metropolis of Toronto when they think "Canada,"
    also think of Calgary, home of the largest rodeo in the world;
    Banff, a resort town in the Rocky Mountains; and Vancouver, Canada's
    gateway to Asia.  You might also think about Saskatchewan, which grows
    much of Canada's food; and the Northwest Territories, home of the
    TV series "Ice Road Truckers."</p>
