        <h1>Design Miami Challenge April 2011</h1>
        
        <p>The Design Miami Challenge for April 2011 is to design and build a
        website for a fictional Canadian-cuisine restaurant here in Coconut
        Grove. We will provide you with the menu, hours, and address, and you
        get to design and build the site. At the May meetup, you'll present
        your idea, we'll all vote on a winner, and they'll win a cool
        certificate and a prize of my choosing.</p>

        <h1>Restaurant Information</h1>
        
        <p>"The Grand Canadian Cafe" is a new fictional bistro in Coconut
        Grove featuring a selection of Canadian/American fusion cuisine
        celebrating the culture, heritage, and spirit of America's Neighbor
        to the North.</p>
        
        <p>The restaurant is located at 2975 Oak Ave, Miami Florida, 33133
        (this is actually Fire Station #8), is open for breakfast, lunch, and
        dinner; and has a bar open until midnight.</p>
        
        <p>While many people think of
        the big eastern metropolis of Toronto when they think "Canada,"
        also think of Calgary, home of the largest rodeo in the world;
        Banff, a resort town in the Rocky Mountains; and Vancouver, Canada's
        gateway to Asia.  You might also think about Saskatchewan, which grows
        much of Canada's food; and the Northwest Territories, home of the
        TV series "Ice Road Truckers."</p>
