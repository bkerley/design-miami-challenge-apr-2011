        <p><strong>VOTING IS AT <a href="http://bit.ly/dmcvote">bit.ly/dmcvote</a></strong></p>
        
        <p>The Design Miami Challenge for April 2011 is to design and build a
        website for a fictional Canadian-cuisine restaurant here in Coconut
        Grove. We will provide you with the menu, hours, and address, and you
        get to design and build the site. <strong>At the May meetup,</strong> you'll present
        your idea, we'll all vote on a winner, and they'll win a cool
        certificate and a prize of my choosing.</p>

        <h1>Restaurant Information</h1>
        
        <p>"The Grand Canadian Cafe" is a new fictional bistro in Coconut
        Grove featuring a selection of Canadian/American fusion cuisine
        celebrating the culture, heritage, and spirit of America's Neighbor
        to the North.</p>
        
        <p>The restaurant is located at 2975 Oak Ave, Miami Florida, 33133
        (this is actually Fire Station #8), is open for breakfast, lunch, and
        dinner; and has a bar open until midnight.</p>
        
        <p>While many people think of
        the big eastern metropolis of Toronto when they think "Canada,"
        also think of Calgary, home of the largest rodeo in the world;
        Banff, a resort town in the Rocky Mountains; and Vancouver, Canada's
        gateway to Asia.  You might also think about Saskatchewan, which grows
        much of Canada's food; and the Northwest Territories, home of the
        TV series "Ice Road Truckers."</p>
